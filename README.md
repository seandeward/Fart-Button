# FartButton

Just for fun. It helped me learn some basics of JavaScript.

## Future Feature Wishlist

### High Score

- I'd love to add a High Score feature that saves the highest number to local storage

### Misc. Sound Effects

- Sound effects for every 100 button clicks, maybe a small quiet click sound for the button itself each time it's pressed (though that could get annoying fast lol).

### More Fart Sounds

- A wider variety of fart sounds could improve the enjoyment reusability of the application.
